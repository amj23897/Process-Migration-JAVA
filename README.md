# Process-Migration-JAVA

Multiple clients supported : One server can check/control the status of all processes of all clients .
Function call to migratable process on demand : invoke a function of a running migratable process with an input command.
Network communication scalable. Generalized message structure and dispatcher makes it possible to add any type of message to the framework conveniently.
Load balancer friendly. The control manager class (Server Operator class) is loosely decoupled from all other parts in server side. There is scope to a custom load balancer (future work! ).
